                    The major aim of the B.Tech/M.Tech UG Student Connect Initiative Program is to invite UG
                    students from various universities/Institutions to participate in this conference. The basic
                    idea behind the scheme is to encourage UG Students towards the RF and Microwave domain by
                    providing them exposure during the conference. Through this scheme, the plan is to invite
                    50 students from various institutions/universities, who would be offered complimentary
                    registration to attend the full event.
