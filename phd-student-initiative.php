          The major aim of the PhD Student Initiative Program is to invite mid-stage PhD students from universities
          across India to participate in this conference. The basic idea behind the scheme is to encourage early level
          doctoral candidates in the RF and Microwave domain to provide them exposure during the conference, so that
          they may carry out quality work during their PhD program. The PhD student initiative would thus facilitate
          these students in transitioning to niche topics. Through this scheme, the plan is to invite several students
          from various institutions all over the country, who would be offered complimentary registration to attend
          the full event.
          <br><br>
