                                Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, located north of Ahmedabad, was originally the residence of Mahatma Gandhi and his spouse Kasturba. The ashram is flanked by a calm and quiet stretch by the Sabarmati River. This is also the location where Gandhi started his Dandi March from. Because it was located in between a prison and a cemetery, Gandhi believed that a Satyagrahi would certainly end his life in either a prison or a graveyard. Sabarmati Ashram will reawaken your sense of independence. The museum is the most well-known of the many institutions within the Sabarmati ashram's grounds.
                                <br>
                                Various personal letters and images of Gandhi are displayed throughout the space. Upasana Mandir, Magan Niwas, Vinoba, Nandini, and Kutir are some of the ashram's other structures. The ashram is now a historical site, having witnessed numerous historical occurrences. You can also visit this place and learn more about India's ancient history.
