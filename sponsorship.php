          IEEE MTT-S and IEEE AP-S have come together and signed a MoU for combining two flagship conferences
          of the respective societies in India (IMaRC and InCAP) to a single conference: Microwave, Antennas,
          and Propagation Conference (MAPCON). The first edition of MAPCON is planned to be organized in
          Bangalore, India during Dec 12-15, 2023.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          The key focus of this conference will be on expert talks by internationally renowned professionals,
          workshops/tutorials by eminent speakers, oral/poster paper presentations by researchers and exhibition
          by global industries. MAPCON 2023 is a right opportunity to showcase state of the art technologies,
          measurement facilities and modelling tools available in Antenna/Microwave & RF industries.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          This is a 5 days long conference where nearly 1000 participants from various countries (USA, Europe,
          UK, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea etc.), Indian research organizations (ISRO, BARC, DRDO, IPR
          etc.) and Indian academic institutes (IITs & NITs etc.) are expected to attend this conference. This
          international event offers an outstanding opportunity to exhibit company's products/services and
          applications to a vibrant and engaged audience and provides an ideal platform to reach hundreds of
          key decision makers.
